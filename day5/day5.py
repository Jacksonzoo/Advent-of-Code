# Open the input file and find a way to section the 'rules' and 'updates' so that we can differentiate the two



# The goal is to look at the updats and see if they follow the 'rules' (X|Y) where page X at some point comes before page Y
# Disregarding the rules that do not apply, if the updates abide by the relevant rules record the middle page number
# Return the sum of all the middle page numebrs of the correctly ordered and rule abiding updates
