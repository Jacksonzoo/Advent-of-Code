# Open the file into a simple array



# I want to parse through each number and assign it an "ID" value i < len array i ++
# Next divide each number by alternating between them as file then free space
# Create a new array to store the number of block files for each ID and "." number of free spaces
# Then move file blocks one at a time from the end of the array to the first free space in the array
# Each file block position would then need to be multiplied by the ID of the file; incremented in a counter
# Return the sum
