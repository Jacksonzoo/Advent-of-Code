# Open the input files as usable instrucitons







# Part 1, given a list of instructions of robot positions (p) and how they move along a tile each second (v),
# the goal is to find a safety score which is obtained by dividing the grid into 4 equal quadrants and
# multiplying how many robots are in each quadrant by each other
# Note that if robots move 'outside' the grid, they essentially move to the other side as if it were an extended grid
# Robots can also overlap with each other
