# Start by initializing a counter to 0 and adding a list of the necessary directions the guard can move
# Find the guard in the grid and make not of its position
# Create a while loop that will impose certain instructions depending on the position of the guard
# If the guard reaches an obstacle "#", position the guard to make a 90 degree right turn and proceed
# The guard leaves an "X" at every position it has been in, when the guard exits the grid, return the sum of "X"s
