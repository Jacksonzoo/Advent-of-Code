# Open the file as a grid so we get our 'topographic map'




# An optimal hiking path is one where we start at height 0 and reach heigh 9 gradually increasing by 1
# A trailhead is the start of the trail, height of 0
# Trailhead score is the number of positions at height of 9 we can reach via an optimal path
# Find the trailscore for each trailhead and return the sum
