# Open the input file as button instructions and answer




# Part 1 describes a claw magine arcade game, where instead of joystick we have 2 buttons "A" and "B"
# Assuming we start at (0, 0) on a grid, we need to reach the prize at location (x, y)
# Button A costs 3 tokens to use and moves along the X and Y axis a certain amount
# Button B costs 1 token to use and also moves along the X and Y axis a certain amount
# Goal is to find the least amount of tokens used to win as many prizes as possible
